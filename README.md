#Intro: Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development is a style of progamming where developers write tests to check their code before writing the code itself. It's an industry-wide practice that leads to better programming, increased efficiency, and less bugs in the long term. We're going to be using TDD in several of our labs going forward, so this lesson will serve as a brief introduction to the process. By the end of the lesson you will be able to understand the purpose of and use Test Driven Development to solve challenges. Good luck!
